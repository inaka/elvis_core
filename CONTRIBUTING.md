## Issues (New Features, Rules & Bug Reports)

If you have a feature or rule you want to see added to Elvis, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/inaka/elvis/issues) before doing any work, so that we can discuss it and
figure out what to do about it.

In the case of rules, keep in mind you can always create your
[User Defined Rules](https://github.com/inaka/elvis#user-defined-rules), in order to run them
locally.

When you find a bug in one of Elvis's rules or the way Elvis itself work, please provide detailed
steps that show how to reproduce the problem.

## Rules

When an issue is already marked with the `rule` label and you are interested in working on it,
first check there is no existing [branch](https://github.com/inaka/elvis/branches) with the
issue's number. If so, you can go ahead and start working on it.

The following is a checklist you can follow when implementing a new Elvis rule:

- [ ] Write both test cases that fail and that pass the rule.
- [ ] Edit [RULES.md](RULES.md), and add a specific file (same name as rule) to folder `doc_rules`.
- [ ] When the issue has the label `default rule`, add the rule to
[Default Rules in Elvis Webhook](https://github.com/inaka/elvis/wiki/Default-Rules-in-Elvis-Webhook)
and in the [`config/elvis.config`](https://github.com/inaka/elvis/blob/HEAD/config/elvis.config)
file.
