# God Modules

The number of functions in a module should be limited to a maximum threshold.

> Works on `.beam` file? Yes!

## Rationale

Limiting the number of functions in a module helps maintain clarity, modularity, and readability
in the codebase. A module with too many functions can become difficult to navigate, understand,
and maintain. By restricting the number of functions, you encourage smaller, more focused modules
that adhere to the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
(SRP). This also makes the code easier to test, debug, and extend.

## Options

- `limit :: non_neg_integer()`
  - default: `25`

## Example

```erlang
{elvis_style, god_modules, #{ limit => 25 }}
```
