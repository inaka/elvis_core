# Prefer Unquoted Atoms [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/since-4.0.0-blue)](https://github.com/inaka/elvis_core/releases/tag/4.0.0)

Atoms should not be quoted unless syntactically necessary.

## Quick fix

Use an Erlang code formatter that enforces strict rules for quoted atoms.

## Options

- None.

## Example configuration

```erlang
{elvis_style, prefer_unquoted_atoms, #{}}
```
